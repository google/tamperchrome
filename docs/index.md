Tamper Dev is an extension that allows you to edit HTTP/HTTPS requests and responses as they happen without the need of a proxy.

[![Avaliable in the Chrome Web Store](assets/cws.png)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tamper-chrome/mdemppnhjflbejfbnlddahjbpdbeejnn)

Press Alt+T or click on the extension button, and you'll be able to filter requests. Once you have a filter you like, enable interception, and you'll be able to modify all requests before they are sent to the server and before the responses are sent back to the browser.

|---|---|---|
| Tamper with the requests sent by your browser, even if encrypted | Observe how the server reacts to your modifications, interactively | Modify the response that your browser receives from the server |
