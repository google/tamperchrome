# Tamper DEV
Tamper Dev is an extension that allows you to edit HTTP/HTTPS requests and responses as they happen without the need of a proxy.

Press Alt+T or click on the extension button, and you'll be able to filter requests. Once you have a filter you like, enable interception, and you'll be able to modify all requests before they are sent to the server and before the responses are sent back to the browser.
